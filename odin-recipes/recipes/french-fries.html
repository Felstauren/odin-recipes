        <h1>french fries</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 gm potato               </li>
            <li>salt as required            </li>
            <li>2 cup refined oil           </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the potatoes       </li>
            <p>To prepare this easy recipe, you need to make sure that they are cut in the right shape and size. They should neither be too thick, nor too thin and should be cut clean and sharp. The trick is to first slice the potatoes and then cut them lengthwise. You can also use a fries cutter for that long, even shape.            </p>
            <li>Soak cut potatoes in ice-cold water for 10-15 minutes</li>
            <p>Now, wash the potatoes under running water till they are squeaky clean. Place them in a bowl of iced water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep them submerged in water or they will turn black.            </p>
            <li>Deep fry the potato fries</li>
            <p>Now, heat the oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the smoke starts appearing, reduce the flame and allow it to acquire a lower temperature. Now, deep fry the potatoes in batches. Keep the flame low. This will make them crunchy and also help retain their colour.            </p>
            <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper and serve hot</li>
            <p>Drain excess oil and place them on an absorbent paper. Allow them to cool. Now sprinkle salt and pepper and toss well. Serve immediately with ketchup. They can also be served with burgers and cutlets.            </p>
